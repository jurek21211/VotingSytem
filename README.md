 VotingSystem
It's an University project I did with my friends. System was designed to allow voting between two options like 'Yes' or 'No', 'A' or 'B' etc. The process of voting is binary. Voting System was based on Raspberry Pi 2 ver. B with AdaFruit RFID/NFC Shield and some NFC cards which have been used as IDs of voting people. Offline system is extended by online website that allows voting remotely. Voters are allowed to take a part in poll anyway they wish, by the device, logging in with NFC card or using the website logging with their card number. Both website and Rpi shared a database that was designed to store data about polls and peopel registered to the system.
